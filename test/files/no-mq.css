/*
  This test file deliberately does NOT include any media queries.

  A bug in media_hunter.js (see https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp/issues/54)
  meant that CSS files without media queries would cause patternlab builds to fail.

  With the fix applied, the build will succeed.

  Since the MediaHunter scans directories and processes all CSS files it finds, all of the
  existing test cases in media_hunter_tests.js will now also process this file. There is
  therefore no need to write an additional test - the presence of this CSS file acts as
  the test.
